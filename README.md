# Stroke Prediction Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project explores patient health data to analyze and predict stroke risk.  
It includes *data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling class imbalance, and building **machine learning models* like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to identify key factors contributing to stroke.

## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (missing values handled)  
- Visualized relationships between features using plots and heatmaps  
- Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest models  
- Identified important features like *age, hypertension, heart disease, and glucose level*  

## Skills & Tools
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | SMOTE  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the Stroke_Prediction_EDA.ipynb notebook in Jupyter  
3. Install required packages (if needed):  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
